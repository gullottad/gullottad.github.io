      <h3>What Cookies Mean to Us</h3>
      <p>
        In times of harship, humanity has various ways of ebbing the pain of what is bringing them down.
        Some find solace in alchohol, others in sweets. We see cookies as a gateway to a better life that succedes the dark wasteland you are seemingly stuck in.
        Sugar is scientifically proven to make humans increase their happiness, and the sugar-filled nature of the cookie, combined with its easily consumable structure, are the best tool for utilizing this scientific theory.
        We hold cookies in the heighest regard of psycological medicine, and we suggest you share our infatuation and put on your bakers hat.
